This is my first blog post here. I have been using Medium for my initial works. But I felt I had to migrate here to break away from their story and read limits to provide to a wider audience.

I am learning a lot of new things lately! I wish to document some of those along with some helpful resources for you to use.

Stay in touch!

2) Embed the gist using the syntax below
{{< gist github-username gist-id >}}
3) This is a Hugo shortcode for embedding Github gists 
4) Many more shortcodes are there for multiple formatting and embedding like Youtube videos etc.-->
